/**
 * De-migration: rewriting `alias:<name>` references back to a concrete id when
 * the alias they name stops existing (issue #386, ADR-0017).
 *
 * A Model alias has no identity apart from its name, so "renaming" one is
 * indistinguishable from deleting it and creating another. Left alone, that
 * would hard-fail every Agent and Chat pointing at the old name — across every
 * attached Workspace for a Shared Provider — and the Org Admin who renamed it
 * would find out only when turns start failing. Rewriting the references to the
 * concrete id the alias pointed at keeps each one running against the exact
 * model it was already using.
 *
 * This is the one place a Provider edit bulk-rewrites Agents and Chats. It is
 * justified here and NOT for alias creation, where doing nothing is harmless:
 * adding an alias changes no entry's `id`, so every existing reference keeps
 * resolving and a rewrite would be cosmetic. Here, doing nothing breaks turns.
