 * Extractors are loaded with a dynamic `import()` so `unpdf` (a pdf.js build)
 * and `mammoth` stay off the startup path: a deployment that never attaches a
 * document never pays for them.
 *
 * Nothing here throws: an unknown format, bytes that don't match the declared
 * format, and a scanned PDF with no text layer all resolve to a non-`ok`
 * outcome. The caller turns that into an announced placeholder, so a bad
 * document can never hard-fail conversion and brick a chat.
